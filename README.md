==========================THE CLIENT CODE===================================

Greetings, client user telescope. This code gets you connected with (soon-to-be re-christened) SCOT: the Server for Co-ordinating Observations of Transients, and automatically directs you to any target you request from it, provided SCOT responds affirmatively.

============================================================================

For Humans:
