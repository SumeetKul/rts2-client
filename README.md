==========================THE CLIENT CODE===================================

Greetings, client user telescope. This code gets you connected with (soon-to-be re-christened) SCOT: the Server for Co-ordinating Observations of Transients, and automatically directs you to any target you request from it, provided SCOT responds affirmatively.

============================================================================

For Humans:

Please refer to the client-code information manual (in pdf format) present in this repository. Follow all the steps carefully, and get ready to play!

Update one.1 ends. Expect a lot of changes here. See you soon!
